# Welcome to the Model Garden for TensorFlow

The TensorFlow Model Garden is a repository with a number of different implementations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and modeling solutions for TensorFlow users. We aim to demonstrate the best practices for modeling so that TensorFlow users can take full advantage of TensorFlow for their research and product development.

## Structure

| Folder | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [official](official) | • **A collection of example implementations for SOTA models using the latest TensorFlow 2's high-level APIs**<br />• Officially maintained, supported, and kept up to date with the latest TensorFlow 2 APIs<br />• Reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read |
| [research](research) | • A collection of research model implementations in TensorFlow 1 or 2 by researchers<br />• Up to the individual researchers to maintain the model implementations and/or provide support on issues and pull requests |
